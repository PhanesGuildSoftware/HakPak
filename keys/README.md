# HakPak Legacy License Keys (Deprecated)

HakPak is now fully open source (MIT). The prior license verification system has been **deprecated** and will be removed in a future major release (≥2.0). This directory persists only to avoid breaking older automation that still expects a `public.pem`.

## Status
- Activation commands are now no-ops.
- `public.pem` is ignored by the runtime (kept only for backward compatibility).
- Any existing license files are disregarded.

## For Users
You no longer need a key or license file. Just install and use HakPak.

## Future
This directory (and associated scripts) will be removed once the deprecation period ends. If you have a strong use case for retaining a signed attribution token, open an issue explaining the workflow.
