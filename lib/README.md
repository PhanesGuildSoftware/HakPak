# lib Directory

This directory previously contained `license.sh`, the proprietary license verification system for legacy "Pro" editions of HakPak.

As of the full open source transition (v1.1.0), the licensing subsystem has been removed. All former gated features are now freely available.

If you need to reference the historical implementation, consult the git history prior to the `v1.1.0` changes (commit removing `lib/license.sh`).

Nothing in this directory is currently required at runtime. It is retained only as a placeholder for future modular extensions.
